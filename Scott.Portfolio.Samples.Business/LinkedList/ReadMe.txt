Simple LinkedList Example
Scott Smith

From Wikipedia:

"In computer science, a linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of
nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node
is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node
in the sequence."

This code consists of;
	- Node - a class with a Data property of type object and a Next property with
	  a type of Node.
	- LinkedList - a class with a Head property (the first Node in the list) and
	  a number of methods for working with the list.
